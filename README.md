Code of Conduct and Procedures Templates
========================================

This repository contains markdown templates for:
 * A custom Code of Conduct
 * Incident Responder procedures for handling Code of Conduct reports
 * Reporter guidelines to set expectations around privacy and time
   estimates for handling reports

These templates are not designed to replace community effort around
how a Code of Conduct incident response team will handle reports.
Communities need to answer tough questions about how they will handle
inappropriate behavior and conflicts of interest. Being transparent with
your community about your processes is the best way to encourage trust.

Similarly, communities are encouraged to seek out training on how to
support people who make Code of Conduct reports, and how to effectively
follow up with someone who has been reported. There are several trainers
who offer Code of Conduct process and enforcement training:

 - [Otter Tech](http://otter.technology/code-of-conduct-training/)
 - [Safety First PDX](http://safetyfirstpdx.org/)
